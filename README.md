# ðŸ“œ Customer management system
App built with MEAN stack for better understanding connection between front-end and back-end side of the application. Fetches data from mongoDB and then displays it to the user, allowing to perform CRUD operations.

**Demo**: ![Demo-gif](https://github.com/XeiTon8/Customers-management-system/blob/main/Example.gif)

 **Functionality**:
 + CRUD operations:
 1. Create - add customers;
 2. Read - search for customers in real time;
 3. Update - update customers;
 4. Delete - delete customers.
 + Auth;
 + Routing (each customer has its own page);

## ðŸš€ Stack
+ Frontend: Angular, ngRx;
+ Backend: MongoDB, Express, Node.js;
+ Auth: Firebase;
+ Libraries: AngularFireAuth, AngularReactiveForms, AngularRouting and others.
+ Additional: SASS, BEM.

## ðŸŒ  Motivation
This project helped me to understand client-to-server interaction and architecture of Angular applications. 

What have I learned:

**1. Building REST APIs.** 
For each CRUD operation I've created an API endpoint filled with neccessary logic for operation (e.g. for fetching all customers API was sending a call to mongoDB to get all documents from the collection)

**2. Creating architecture for Angular applications.** 
Divided the app into different modules:
- Core module with essential components like Auth and Dashboard;
- Features module with features like a single page for each customer;
- Shared module for shared components that could be used in any parts of the application (like Header, buttons, etc).

**3. Using ngRx and rxJS.**
Instailled ngRx to get a better understanding of reactive programming and practice my skills with Flux architecture.
